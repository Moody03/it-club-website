## About

This website was created to serve the IT club’s community. It includes various sections to provide information about the club, ongoing and past projects, and media recommendations, such as movies and series related to technology.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting service for static websites. The website is deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access and fast delivery.
- **Firebase**: A platform for backend services like authentication, hosting, and real-time database.
- **HTML/CSS**: For styling and structure.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend interactivity and logic.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different pages of the website.

## Pages

### Home
The homepage serves as an introduction to the IT Club, showcasing featured content and the latest updates. It includes navigation to other sections of the site.

### About Page
Provides detailed information about the IT Club, including its history, mission, and values. You can also learn about the team members and key events.

### Project Page

### Contact Page
Allows users to contact the IT Club for inquiries. It includes a contact form connected to Firebase for submissions and a section with the club's contact details (email, phone, etc.).

### Movie/Series Page
Features a list of recommended movies and series related to technology, IT, and innovation. This page also allows users to submit their own recommendations.

## Security Considerations

To ensure the website is secure, we’ve implemented the following best practices:

1. **Authentication**: We use **Firebase Authentication** to handle user sign-ins and ensure secure login mechanisms.
   
2. **HTTPS**: The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages** with **SSL encryption**, ensuring secure communication between users and the website.

3. **Input Validation**: All forms (e.g., the contact form) perform input validation both on the client-side and server-side to avoid malicious data submissions.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**: We use Firebase Firestore Security Rules to control access to sensitive data. Only authorized users can modify content on the website.
   
5. **Password Management**: We recommend strong passwords for user accounts. Passwords are stored securely using Firebase Authentication’s built-in hashing mechanism.

6. **CORS Protection**: We have configured Firebase Hosting and backend services to prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues and unauthorized requests.

7. **Regular Security Audits**: The project is subject to regular security audits, including dependency checks for vulnerabilities.
